*IPL Powerplay Match Predictor*

Indian Premier League is one of the most popular domestic T20 leagues in the world. Many Players capped/uncapped show interest in being part of this league with huge price tags against them in auctions 🧑🏻‍⚖️. So, there’s a huge chance of shuffling of teams during these auctions which makes it tough to predict the outcome of a match except few teams who have a chance to retain the core players. Hence, I have chose to predict match outcomes solely on team’s Powerplay Scores, Target, and a few other features. Let’s Deep dive 🏊 in to know more details👇.
